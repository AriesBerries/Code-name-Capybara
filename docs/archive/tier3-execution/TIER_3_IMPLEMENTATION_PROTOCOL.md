## Tier 3 Artifact Inventory

### ARTIFACT_19_DEVGUIDE_COCKPIT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md ⚡ ULTRA CRITICAL

**Status:** Sequential (must be last)  
**Current Version:** 2.0.0  
**Target Version:** 2.1.0 (MINOR - updated timeline/resources)  
**Estimated Time:** 4.5 hours (first pass) + 2 hours (second pass)  
**UltraThink Required:** ✅ YES - BOTH PASSES

**What It Does:**
- Synthesizes implementation tasks from ALL updated artifacts
- Defines 3-month MVP roadmap with weekly breakdown
- Specifies team structure (7 engineers + roles)
- Calculates updated budget with new systems
- Sets success metrics and acceptance criteria

**Why It's Ultra Critical:**
- This is the executable plan the team follows
- Errors here delay the entire project
- Resource miscalculations waste budget
- Missing tasks discovered late are expensive
- Timeline slippage cascades to all stakeholders

**Depends On:**
- ARTIFACT_05 (schema setup tasks for Week 1)
- ARTIFACT_03 (Bin validation setup for Week 1)
- ARTIFACT_06 (UI development tasks for Month 2)
- ARTIFACT_04 (AI layer integration for Month 2)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ULTRATHINK FOCUS AREAS:

Please use extended thinking for these critical planning decisions:

1. 🔍 TIMELINE REALISM
   - Is Week 1 overloaded with metadata setup + existing tasks?
   - Should we extend to 4 months instead of 3?
   - Which tasks can be parallelized?
   - Where are the bottlenecks?

2. 🔍 RESOURCE ALLOCATION
   - Is 7 engineers sufficient for expanded scope?
   - Should we add a dedicated metadata engineer?
   - Can DevOps handle expanded scope (Phi-3, clock sync, hooks)?
   - Do we need a security engineer for CAP-SEC implementation?

3. 🔍 DEPENDENCY ORDERING
   - Must metadata governance be 100% before Month 2?
   - Can AI Cortex and Extension Orchestration run in parallel?
   - What's the critical path through the timeline?
   - Which tasks have the most dependencies?

4. 🔍 RISK ASSESSMENT
   - What if Phi-3 Mini doesn't perform as expected?
   - What if clock sync requires dedicated hardware?
   - What if metadata compliance takes longer than Week 1?
   - What's the fallback plan for each major system?

5. 🔍 SUCCESS METRICS
   - Are >95% metadata compliance and <10ms clock drift achievable?
   - How do we measure "90% tool call reduction"?
   - What's the minimum viable success for MVP launch?
   - Which metrics are critical vs nice-to-have?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUALITY GATES:

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] All Month 1-3 timelines updated with new tasks
- [ ] Team structure reflects 7 engineers with correct scopes
- [ ] Budget updated with all new systems
- [ ] Success metrics include metadata governance
- [ ] Risk assessment covers all new systems
- [ ] Dependencies between tasks documented
- [ ] Critical path identified
- [ ] Version bumped to 2.1.0
- [ ] All timestamps in Zulu format
- [ ] Metadata Mini-Protocol followed throughout

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SYNTHESIS METHODOLOGY:

For each updated artifact, extract:
1. **Implementation tasks** - What needs to be built?
2. **Timeline impact** - Where in Month 1-3 does it fit?
3. **Resource needs** - Which engineer roles are required?
4. **Dependencies** - What must complete first?
5. **Success criteria** - How do we know it's done?

Then integrate into master plan maintaining:
- Logical task ordering
- Realistic time estimates
- Clear ownership
- Measurable outcomes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CRITICAL REMINDERS:

⚠️ This plan will be executed by the team - must be complete
⚠️ Timeline errors delay product launch and cost money
⚠️ Resource miscalculations waste budget
⚠️ Missing tasks discovered late are 10x more expensive
⚠️ Success metrics define when we can launch

USE EXTENDED THINKING MODE. Synthesize carefully from ALL 8 artifacts.

Please proceed with ULTRA CAREFUL timeline synthesis.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ULTRATHINK REVIEW AREAS:

Please use extended thinking to deeply analyze:

1. 🔍 CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS
   Walk through the longest dependency chain:
   - ARTIFACT_05 → ARTIFACT_03 → ARTIFACT_06 → Full System
   - If any task on critical path delays, entire project delays
   - Which tasks MUST not slip?
   - Where is there flexibility?

2. 🔍 RESOURCE BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS
   Map each engineer's workload by week:
   - Week 1: Who is overallocated?
   - Week 5: Can Extension Orchestration really happen in parallel?
   - Month 3: Is polish time sufficient or placeholder?

3. 🔍 HIDDEN TASK DISCOVERY
   What tasks might be missing?
   - Testing time for each system?
   - Documentation time?
   - Code review cycles?
   - Deployment/rollback procedures?
   - Training time for team on new systems?

4. 🔍 FAILURE MODE SIMULATION
   If we're at Day 30 and metadata compliance is only 60%, what happens?
   - Do we delay Month 2?
   - Do we lower success criteria?
   - Do we add engineers?
   - What's the decision tree?
